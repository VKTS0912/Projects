In this project, we propose the linear and angular position control of a stepper-motor-driven self-balancing robot.
A linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is tuned to obtain accurate control of the system.
To find the gain vector K for the controller, run the m file lqr_self_balancing_robot.m
After that, run the file real_physical_model_SBR.slx to simulate the robot.
For reference, you can also view the mathematical model of the SBR in self_balance_cart.slx
