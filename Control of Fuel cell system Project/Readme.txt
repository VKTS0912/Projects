Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are the most promising fuel cell technology because of their high-power density, low operating temperature, quick startup capability, and low weight.
Through this project, we managed to model and draw the characteristic curve of the fuel cell. Moreover, a sliding mode controller for PEMFC system has been designed, successfully extracting the maximum power of the fuel cell
