Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are the most promising fuel cell technology because of their high power density, low operating temperature, quick startup capability, and low weight.
Through this project, we managed to model and draw the characteristic curve of the fuel cell. Moreover, a sliding mode controller for the PEMFC system has been designed, successfully extracting the maximum power of the fuel cell
To see the characteristic curves of the fuel cell, run the 'fuel_cell_characteristic.slx' file to save the data values, then run the 'characteristic_plot.m' to plot the graph.
The design and simulation of obtaining the fuel cell's maximum power are shown in 'smc_controller.slx' file.
